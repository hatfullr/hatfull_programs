These programs require that you edit the directories in the
first few lines to specify which data files you want them to
read. Make sure you finish the directory with a '/'. For
example, 'simdir = "/home/hatfull/place/"'.

Be careful, because all of these files will need a model file
with the same format as the *.mod.muse file. THIS IS NOT THE
SAME FILE AS FOUND IN THE SIMULATION DIRECTORY!
